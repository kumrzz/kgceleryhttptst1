now trying https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/master/examples/httpexample  
curl didn't work on git bash using ngrok 


using code from https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/master/examples/celery_http_gateway  
only this works:  
http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/  
so basically didn't work mostly due to deprecated code
